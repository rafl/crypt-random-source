=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Moose;
	extends qw(Crypt::Random::Source::Base::Handle);

	sub open_handle {
		# invoked as needed
	}


	# this class can also be used directly
	Crypt::Random::Source::Base::Handle->new( handle => $file_handle );


	# it supports some standard methods:

	$p->blocking(0);

	$p->read( my $buf, $n ); # no error handling here

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a concrete base class for all L<IO::Handle> based random data sources.

It implements error handling

=attr handle

An L<IO::Handle> or file handle to read from.

=attr blocking

This is actually handled by C<handle>, and is documented in L<IO::Handle>.

=attr allow_under_read

Whether or not under reading is considered an error.

Defaults to false.

=attr reread_attempts

The number of attempts to make at rereading if the handle did not provide
enough bytes on the first attempt.

Defaults to 1.

Only used if C<allow_under_read> is enabled.

=method get

See L<Crypt::Random::Source::Base/get>.

When C<blocking> or C<allow_under_read> are set to a true value this method may
return fewer bytes than requested.

=method read

This delegates directly to C<handle>.

It B<DOES NOT> provide the same validation as C<get> would have, so no checking
for underreads is done.

=method close

Close the handle and clear it.

=method _read

C<< $self->handle->read >> but with additional error checking and different
calling conventions.

=method _read_too_short

Called by C<_read> when not enough data was read from the handle. Normally it
will either die with an error or attempt to reread. When C<allow_under_read> is
true it will just return the partial buffer.

=method open_handle

Abstract method, should return an L<IO::Handle> to use.
